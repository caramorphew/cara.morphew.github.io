              <p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2018 by <a href="#">Cara Morphew</a></p>
      
              <p>Navigating the application process for top business schools can be complicated, intimidating and sometimes overwhelming. The fact is, applying to even just one school requires not only a strong knowledge of what the program offers, but also how you, as an applicant, can fit in and actively contribute.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Unlike when applying to undergraduate universities or other graduate programs, your MBA candidacy goes beyond just qualifications. It requires a deep understanding of the nuances of each school — you need to know how your experience and goals will explicitly fit into these programs’ different cultures and competencies.</p>
              <p>Top MBA programs offer great information on the diverse classes, clubs and other opportunities at their schools. Websites, seminars, on campus tours and more strive to demonstrate where programs excel. Problem is… it’s a lot to digest, especially while working a full-time job.</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>Now, repeat the process across multiple schools as you explore which is best for you — just beginning to apply quickly becomes a huge task.</p>
                <p><strong>Friends, family and co-workers</strong></p>
                <p>In some situations, personal and professional networks can be very helpful. However, availability of advice is inconsistent, especially across geographies and industries. Sure, you may have a good friend willing to help at one MBA program, but it’s less likely to know people across multiple schools.</p>
                <p>Even if you do, getting real advice and feedback can be tough. Light conversations on programs’ strengths? Easy enough if you know a few people or are willing to cold email students. Deep engagement on your candidacy from relevant, knowledgeable students or alumni? Often harder to come by. Even asking for a recommendation from a co-worker can be an awkward process, requiring a large time commitment from a colleague. Soliciting feedback on essays and application strategy can be even more challenging, leaving prospective students faced with doing it all on their own.</p>
                <p>So, candidates encounter a significant challenge — high information need, but limited accessibility.</p>
                <p><strong>“Expert” consultants</strong></p>
                <p>Enter the admissions consulting industry. Full of big promises and even bigger price points (often charging $5,000 — $10,000 for advice on a few schools), MBA admission consultants are estimated to be used by a third of applicants to top programs.</p>
                <p>These full-time consultants’ true value can be difficult to ascertain. Often at least a few years removed from business school, consultants may provide canned advice, lacking personality and understanding of individual MBA programs’ nuances. Firms advertise their acceptance rates at schools… but rarely disclose the corresponding rate at which they reject candidates upfront that don’t fit their desired profiles. Claims of a “secret sauce” and special understanding of the admissions process are rarely substantiated when talking with the offices actually doing the admitting.</p>
                <p><strong>Something new?</strong></p>
                <p>At BeenThere, we’re trying to address the challenges of the MBA admissions process by enabling meaningful connections with current students. For a fraction of the cost of an “expert” consultant, applicants can work with student mentors to address the unique pain points of their individual process. We strive to give specific solutions to each applicant’s specific problems — serving as a sounding board with deep, engaged feedback and advice.</p>
                <p>Our mentors are matched to applicants to leverage their relevant experience and goals, giving customized advice in tune with the latest on-campus classes, opportunities, and events.</p>
                <p>The goal? More knowledgeable applicants and a smoother, simpler application process.</p>
